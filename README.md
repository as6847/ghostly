# ghostly

welcome to ghostly!

meet your new friend -- theyre a friendly ghost and you can interact with them.

press the first button to change their room color (what colors do you think they like?)

press the second button to change their color (they sure look dashing in a magenta hue)

press the third button to see them move (wow so fast)

press the fourth button to see them hide (where could they be?)

press the fifth button to see them grow and shrink (this window isn't big enough for them!)

have fun!

This project primarily used Javascript, CSS, and HTML in order to create an interactive SVG character.

Random numbers were used in every Javascript function in order to manipulate the SVG character in various ways.

Durational changes can be found in the movement of the footer buttons as well as the style transformations in the Javascript functions.
